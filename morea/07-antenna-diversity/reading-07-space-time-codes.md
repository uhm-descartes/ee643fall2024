# Space-time codes

In [the previous discussion](reading-07-transmit-diversity.html), we achieved the diversity gain with a data rate of one symbol per time slot by using rotation codes across multiple transmit antennas and multiple time slots. But with multiple antennas, our question is how can we further improve this scheme?

## Alamouti scheme

To illustrate the Alamouti scheme, we consider the case of two transmit antennas and single receive antenna.

## General space-time codes
