This module covers Section 3.3 of [the textbook](https://web.stanford.edu/~dntse/papers/book121004.pdf).

In this module, we explore antenna/spatial diversity in communication systems with multiple antennas. 

We introduce space-time codes that achieve antenna diversity, and discuss the tradeoff between diversity gain and spatial multiplexing in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
