  * You understand the input/output models of wireless channels as finite impulse response (FIR) filters.
  * You understand the relationship between channel models in continuous-time passband, in continuous-time baseband, and in discrete-time baseband.
  * You understand how the discrete-time baseband signal is converted to the continuous-time passband signal at the transmit antenna, and how the continuous-time passband signal at the receive antenna is converted back to discrete-time baseband for processing.
  * You can write codes to implement the channel models based on given parameters.
