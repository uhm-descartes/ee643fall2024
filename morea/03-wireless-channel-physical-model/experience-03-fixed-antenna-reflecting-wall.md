# Simulation on coherence distance and coherence bandwidth

Using [this Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NyHWOKCa2XM3JUiloteoLyeSNtgX-xjg?usp=sharing), we can simulate the received signal in [the example of fixed antennas with a reflecting wall](reading-03-reflecting-wall-fixed-antenna.html).

In this notebook, you can compare the coherence distance measured from the numerical simulation and that calculated from the theory. You can also compare the coherence bandwidth from simulation and that from theory.
