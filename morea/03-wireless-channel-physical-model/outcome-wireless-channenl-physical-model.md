  * You know how to derive the physical model of wireless channels using the ray tracing method.
  * You understand the key features of a wireless channel: small-scaling fading, large-scale fading, Doppler shift, delay spread, coherence distance, coherence time, and coherence bandwidth.
  * You understand what factors result in these features (e.g., moving transmitter and/or receiver result in Doppler shift, multipath results in delay spread).
  * You can implement the ray tracing method in Python, and use numerical simulation to study more realistic wireless channels.
