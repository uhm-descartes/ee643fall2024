# Simulation on coherence time

Using [this Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RckFUXT8-xSK6Yr25vMKTLz56sZBxU2m?usp=sharing), we can simulate the received signal in [the example of moving antennas with a reflecting wall](reading-03-reflecting-wall-moving-antenna.html).

In this notebook, you can compare the Doppler spread measured from the numerical simulation and that calculated from the theory. You can also compare the coherence time from simulation and that from theory.
