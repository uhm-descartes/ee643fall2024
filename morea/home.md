# Welcome to EE 643, Spring 2024

In EE 643, we will learn the basics of wireless communication systems, exciting new topics such as the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communications, and emerging paradigms of communication systems such as quantum communication.

## Who should take this course

This course is intended for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students in electrical and computer engineering who want to get up to speed with the frontiers of wireless communication research.

## Pedagogy

EE 643 is structured as a sequential series of [modules](/ee643spring2024/modules/), each taking approximately one to two weeks to complete. Each module has the following structure:

  * [Learning outcomes](/ee643spring2024/outcomes/), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](/ee643spring2024/readings/), providing background material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](/ee643spring2024/experiences/), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](/ee643spring2024/assessments/), which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.
