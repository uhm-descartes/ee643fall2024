In this module, we explore frequency diversity in communication systems. 

We can achieve frequency diversity in different ways:
- intersymbol interference (ISI) equalization;
- direct-sequence spread-spectrum (key technology in 3G communications systems);
- orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (key technology in 4G and beyond).
