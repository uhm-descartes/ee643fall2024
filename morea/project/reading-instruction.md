# Project Description

In this project, we aim to apply what we learn in this course to your research project, and/or expand our knowledge in an emerging research area in wireless communications.

If you are already working on a research project related to wireless, you are welcomed to perform part of your research as your course project. In this case, you would need to
- introduce the motivation and state of the art;
- describe the specific problem you are working on;
- define the tasks you would like to accomplish for the course project;
- show the results.

If you would like to do a literature survey as your course project, you would need to
- provide the motivation of why this research area is important;
- describe the typical problems studied in this area;
- briefly overview the approaches to each problem;
- discuss future research directions.
